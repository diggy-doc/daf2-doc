### How it works

Tiered offer becomes live with Special Offer on Thursday and will last for a week.
Every player will be randomly allocated a Type at the beginning of Tiered Offer, which can be changed by contacting 
Pixel Support. After deciding the Type you want the most, you need to spend gem to buy 1st Tier to activate 2nd Tier,
and so on. Please remember the Type could not be altered after purchasing Tier 1. 

### How to decide which Type

In Equipment/Shop section of DAF2, on the top right, there is a Tiered Offer button to view the details of current live 
Tiered offer. There is no fixed answer that which one suits you the best. It depends on the gem amount, the region 
you are in and whether you spend cash buying Packs. For example, in the early regions, the equipments in Type E will 
be worse than the ones in the later regions. In this case, Type D would be the best option, tier 1 costs 195 gems to 
get a regen which normally costs 395 gems in the weekly Special offer.
