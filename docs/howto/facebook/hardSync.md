# Hard Sync
Hard Sync is to reset the Facebook setting in the game/reinstall the game on Facebook, which should not and does not 
need to be carried out frequently.
To sync friend list (making the newly added friend to be shown in the game given those friends have the correct 
settings), simply click the friend sync button in the Friends interface ![Image](images/friendSync.jpg)

Hard Sync should be used as the last resort, for example the friend list shows the friends as Player not their name!
